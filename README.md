## How do I make a contribution?
Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
3. Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
4. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
5. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug report.
6. Strictly follow the template for PR requests else it wont be considered 
7. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
8. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
9. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! ðŸŽ‰
